This software provides a Python interface to the ILOG CPLEX® Callable Library. It implements a subset of the most commonly used functions. If you need some other function, it should be quite easy it add it yourself (or drop me a line, and I will add it to the next release).

The software is released under MIT Licence. CPLEX® is a registered trademark of ILOG.
